Some things I believe:
- As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences
- Technology, which is really knowledge, enables this
- You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor
- Enthusiasm matters!
- It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
- It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason
- Energy is a necessary input for progress
- It's important to do things fast
- You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
- Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit
- "Slow is fake"
- A week is 2% of the year
- Time is the denominator
- The efficient market hypothesis was never more than a hypothesis and is only kept alive today by people wanting to dunk on it or academics that are not aiming high enough. Any attempt to disprove the null grossily misspecifies the field and undermines the notion that vector performance and vector selection are different things. 
- At best it is a very lossy heuristic
- The best things in life occur where EMH is wrong
- "Most people are other people"
- We know less than we think
- The replication crisis is not an aberration
- Many of the things we believe are wrong
- We are often not even asking the right questions
- The cultural prohibition on micromanagement is harmful
- Great individuals should be fully empowered to exercise their judgment
- The goal is not to avoid mistakes; the goal is to achieve uncorrelated levels of excellence in some dimension, while always living to see another day
- Smaller teams are better
- Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun
- No need to chop up work for political reasons
- No room for mediocre people (can pay more, too!)
- Large-scale engineering projects are more soluble in IQ than they appear
- Many tech companies are 2-10x overstaffed




- Where do you get your dopamine?
- The answer is predictive of your behavior
- Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated
- You can do more than you think


I've jumped out of planes, descended mountains at 60 mph in my bike. Now I want to go to the gym.

The best builders build for the long-term and see their builts through. So don't die.


- The laws of physics are the only limit
